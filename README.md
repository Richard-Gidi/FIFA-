# FIFA-
Did some basic EDA on a FIFA dataset from kaggle.
I analyzed the FIFA world cup data ...pretty interesting I must sayðŸ˜‚.
Libraries used: Plotly, pandas,matplotlib
I didnâ€™t used any machine learning model since I just wanted to analyze the data and not make any predictions 
My findings:
 1. The world cup is played every 4 years 
 2. 1942 and 1946 had no world cup ( I quickly googled online to see what the reason was .....it was due to the 2nd world war)
 3. The highest goal scored in a single match (12 goals) was between Switzerland and Austria on 26th June, 1954 with Austria winning by 7 goals to 5
 4. Best team in the world based on total goals in the world cup is Brazil with 229 goals closely followed by Germany with 226 goals 
 5. Brazil has the most home goals (177) followed by Germany(158)
 6. Germany had the most away goals(68) followed by Uruguay(56)
